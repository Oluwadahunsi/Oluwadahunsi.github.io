				THE ULTIMATE BLOGGING PLUG; </b> What You Need to Succeed as a Blogger</center>

<p>Blogging is a powerful media tool. It has quickly gone from a past time to something more than capable of becoming a full-time job and a regular soource of income stream. A lot of people know this, and that is why there are hundreds of thousands of blogs and bloggers around the world today. 
However, you should know that there is a huge difference between bloggers. You can be the Linda Ikeji of your generation or just another helpless shmuck sitting in front of a laptop every day and hoping to attract 10 viewers on his site (which, by the way, is named <i>dorobucci.com</i> and is riddled with grammatical errors. Yes, these people actually exist).</p> 
<p>So how do you become the former? </p>
<p>That is why you are here.</p> 
<p>This blogging plug contains trade secrets that I have been able to get from various sources. All of these have been rolled into one short and concise harpoon for you. Yeah, you are welcome.</p>
<p>To begin, let me just run a little backstory about myself and my foray into the blogging profession. </p>
<p>Once, when I was in my first year in the university, I went to get a haircut. The salon had a TV and HipTV News was on so while waiting for my turn, I decided to check out what was going on in the country. Then, I came across a headline; </p>
<p> <I> Linda Ikeji acquires home for 800 million Naira </I> (see, this stuff is no joke. That was actually the headline).</p>
<p>
	Omo my mind immediately went on a rampage. <I>800 million what? Jesu! What on this blue Earth does the woman do? Shebi it is only blogging? Ehn oya, let me too blog as well.</I>
	</p>
	<p>
So that was my own <i>founder moment</i>. I got a domain from a guy and I was doing the most I could. However, after about two months in, I still hardly had jackshit to show for all my effort. I felt like a whopping failure and I eventually sold the blog for a tight sum (at least I got half of the money back, thank God). </p>
<p> So there you have it; one of my many epic failures. </p> 
<p> So why exactly did I fail? </p>
<p> Well, the major reason is that I hardly knew much about the <i>ins </i> and <i> outs </i> of the whole blogging thing. So very quickly, we will be taking cues from my mistakes in order to lead you down the right path. </p>
<p> <center> <img src="Hi.gif" ALT="QUICK ONE; BLOGGING IS NO JOKE" height="300"> </center></p>
<p>Look, before you start blogging and typing a way, you need to understand a simple truth right now; 
<b>BLOGGING IS NO JOKE.</b> The fact that a few people make typing look easy and all is no pointer that blogging is something to be taken lightly. It takes a lot of passion and dedication to run a successful bog and if you do not have that, maintaining the success of your blog will be difficult for sure (if you even get substantial success in the first place). </p> 
<P><center><img src="Niche.png" ALT="DETERMINE YOUR NICHE AND WORK WITH IT" height="300"></center></P>
<P>Planning your niche is one of the most important aspects of your blog. This is because your niche determines what you write about. </P>
<p> Now this is where it gets a tad tricky; if you are covering more than one niche on your blog, then the chances of you getting more viewers (and as an extension, more money when you get the right level of exposure) are much higher because your blog will be versatile and multifaceted to a pretty large extent. However, it also means that you will have quite a lot of writing to do and it could sometimes be a pain the behind. The reverse is the case if your blog is niche-specific; less content to write, but less potential readers and income. </p>
<p> Which leads us to;</p>
<p><center><img src="Information.png" alt="PROVIDE YOUR INFORMATION IN REAL-TIME" height="300"></center></p>
<p> If there is one thing that successful blogs have in common, it is that they get news to their readers in real-time. If the President of your country dies today and your blog is just getting the news across tomorrow, your chances of getting an expanding reader base will be pretty low because people only go to blogs to get informed. The moment a person sees something on a blog that you also have, you lose that potential reader (get it?). You have news popping up every second of every day and when they do, you need to be in the know and get ready to write about it. Redundancy is the worst enemy of every blogger and by all means, you should be ready to avoid it. As a quick solve for this, you can employ content developers who will be on the lookout and get relevant information to you quickly.</p>
<p><center><img src="Much Money.png" alt="YOU'LL MOST PROBABLY NOT MAKE MUCH MONEY WHEN YOU START. DON'T BE ALARMED" height="300"></center></p>
<p> This is one of the major facts that I just failed to grasp as a blogger. When I started, the passion to provide information to people and all that was missing. All I wanted to do was get on a keyboard and in a year, have enough money to buy myself a house and stunt on all my classmates. It was a wrong mentality and that was why I gave up so early. Weeks later, I saw an interview of Linda Ikeji where she said she had started blogging for years before she really made tangible money from it.</p>
<p> My point here is that  you should  not expect your phone to start buzzing with alerts as soon as you start blogging making money from it is a gradual process that requires a lot of steps (regular visitors, click-through rates, monetizing etc.) When you start blogging, just do it with a passion for what you do at first. Develop a steady reader base and if you get some cash along the way, all well and good. When you have that steady reader base, then you can look into plan to monetize the blog and start earning a killing</p>
<p> And finally;</p>
<p><center><img src="Monetize.png" alt="DONE ALL THAT? NOW, MONETIZE YOUR BLOG" height="300"></center></p>
<p> Yes, the money question always comes in. I get it (I mean, <I>mans must chow</I>, right?).  </p>
<p> As soon as you develop a reader base, make sure that you monetize your blog (if you want to monetize it, that is). Take advantage of advertising, putting up posters and ads on your page (you can register for Google Adsense for that) and begin using your readers to make money for yourself.</p>

<p> I hope this plug has helped in one way or another. Remember that blogging has the potential to become a steady income stream for you. All you need to know is what to do and when to do it!</p>
<p> Good luck and Godspeed.</p>
